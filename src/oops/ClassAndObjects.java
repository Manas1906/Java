                                    Object
It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of : 

State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

//Syntax for class declaration
public class ClassAndObjects {
//here ClassAndObjects is the class name and is also called as identifier and it should be in camel case and class is a keyword
//whatever we write inside the class,we call it as class body/definition
